        <br>I am currently a senior at Texas A&M University and am expecting to graduate in Fall of 2026, so pretty soon. My major is Computer Science Engineering 
        while I minor in business. For computer science as well as technology in general is my passion but I also have an interest in computer hardware as well. Computer science 
        specifically, I have engaged in many coding projects one of which is the personal website that you are seeing now. One of my goals is to gain an internship over the summer as I 
        have yet to obtain an official position for engaging with software and I hope that can change in the future as I want to gain as much experience with software as possible. 
        For my personal hobbies I love to play fighting games such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter">street fighter</a>  but I love watching anime as well, specifically romance dramas such as my favorite one, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_Memories">Plastic Memories</a> (It's really sad, not for the faint of heart). Additionally I listen to plenty of music in my spare 
        time and listen to my favorite artists such as <a href = "https://open.spotify.com/artist/4tZwfgrHOc3mvqYlEYSvVi">Daft Punk</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0oSGxfWSnnOXhD2fKuz2Gy">David Bowie</a>, both of whom are incredible musical legends. Speaking of legends though, none of my family has ever been 
        able to attend college or university so I am a first generation college student and have been carving my own path in life to engage in something different than my family. For my 
        contact information I have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evan-luu-49b35428a/">LinkedIn</a> and <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/ehpo0?igsh=b243dnVhMjZwbTcz&utm_source=qr">instagram</a>
         so if you wish to contact me and get to know me I'm available through there. I'm very extroverted and love meeting new people especially with team based projects so feel free to contact me anytime. Hope to hear from you and a pleasure to catch your attention, feel free explore around and learn even more about me if you so desire.
        (Side note the fantasy picture background in one of themes is from Final Fantasy X and I have learn history on the side as you can see on the other theme.)
